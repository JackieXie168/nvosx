	This is the main documentation for the nvram utility by Jackie Xie.

How do I save/restore the whole NVRAM contents?
-----------------------------------------------
There is no special command to do this; but there's a field "nvram" in the
standard configuration files which is same as useful. To save the whole NVRAM
contents (aside from the time/date of the clock), do

	# nvram show >nvram.saved

To restore the whole contents, do

	# nvram restore nvram.saved

or

	# nvram reload nvram.saved

The saved contents is restored into the NVRAM in verbatim. Please notice that is 
very unlikely that the saved NVRAM contents is useful for any other computer 
than the one it was being saved on.

When you got an error such as "attach_share_memory failed ..." for running nvram,
you should execute the "./remove_shm.sh" or "./remove_shm.csh" under src path to 
release the allocated memory first.


How do I parsing the NVRAM variable contents?
-----------------------------------------------
To use the nvram utility to do related functions.
It could be to check the verify tool 'test_nvram.sh' to get more information in detail.
